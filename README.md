# Muse IO

A utility web app for playing around with the Muse headset.

## Get started

*NOTE: This website connects to a local server vi websocket and streams muse-readings to the server.*

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
5. The UI offers some basic controls, bit the magic should happen on the server - go nuts!


## Made with

* [Muse-js](https://github.com/urish/muse-js) - a Javascript-client for the Muse headset.
* Socket.io - for managing socket-connection to server.
